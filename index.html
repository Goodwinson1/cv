  <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Cox Communications, Inc<br />
    Lead Network Engineer<br />
  2012 - Current</strong>
  </p>
<p>
  <strong>Mapping of Address and Port Translation (MAP-T)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Provided a highly reliable, robust, and scalable network architecture for MAP-T services across the company’s nationwide IP backbone, effectively extending the useful life of IPv4.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluated industry routing vendors for platforms which support MAP-T features, measured these platforms against industry specifications i.e. RFC 7599, and selected optimal platform(s) for organization needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed and performed large scale lab testing strategy to validate MAP-T platform(s) per RFC 7599 specifications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Collaborated with internal boundary partners or teams i.e. Network Intelligence, Network Monitoring, Access Engineering, etc. to ensure a ‘holistic’ MAP-T implementation with minimal disruption to IP network.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created a high-level design document to formally communicate MAP-T design details to Engineering organization.
  </li>
  <li>
    MAP-T provides an efficient solution to IPv4 address depletion problem and is significantly less expensive than alternatively purchasing IPv4 addresses from the gray market.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed and designed an RPKI architecture to improve BGP security for the Cox IP Backbone
  </li>
  <li>
    Collaborated with Industry organizations (MANRS, Cablelabs) on best practices for BGP security and specifically for RPKI design, implementation, and components.  Ultimately proposed optimal solution specific to the needs of the Cox IP Backbone.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created a high-level design document which provided education, vision, and guidance to the Engineering organization for the implementation of BGP RPKI
  </li>
  <li>
    Created lab testing strategy to validate the functionality of BGP RPKI and its networking components
  </li>
  <li>
    The solution resulted in securing the Cox IP Backbone from BGP hijacks due to route leaks.  Further this is consistent with the security mandates and guidelines of the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) as well as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Nationwide IP Backbone Design Update</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Successfully implemented full redesign of the Cox nationwide IP backbone which resulted in greater network routing and operational efficiencies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Created test strategy and procedures for lab validation of new network design.   Compiled testing results and presented to national engineering teams.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed migration strategy and “best practices” maintenance procedures and led efforts to implement design changes in 75% of company markets. Also created a ‘check list’ of items prior to maintenance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Gained efficiencies from each site post migration by communicating any ‘lessons learned’ with boundary partners.
  </li>
  <li>
    Led a subcommittee of about 8 engineers in creating an “IP Playbook” with best practices and standardized configurations.
  </li>
  <li>
    The solution resulted in a more efficient network design with significant reduction of operating expenses
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Next Generation Router Evaluation</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Led Engineering Team in evaluating core and edge routing products for use and interoperability within the Internet Backbone
  </li>
  <li>
    Built a fully meshed IP/MPLS lab network simulating all features and functionality of production network for use as a test bed
  </li>
  <li>
    Developed project plan for lab trials and authored test plan to evaluate new routing products against a full suite of protocols to ensure functionality, stability, and RFC compliance
  </li>
  <li>
    Produced detail report on lab certification finding and made recommendations to upper management
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Router Software (IOS-XR, JUNOs) Regression Testing</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Determined direction of Service Provider Backbone Network from a software perspective and drove vendors to produce viable options
  </li>
  <li>
    Led efforts in working with Router vendors to produce software exception build when candidate software did not meet Company’s Network requirements
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluated software (JUNOs, IOS, etc.) for new features, bug fixes, stability, and usability with existing services within the company’s Internet Backbone
  </li>
  <li>
    Created software validation document which details testing procedures and results for implementation onto production network devices.
  </li>
</ul>
